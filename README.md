Halo, looks like this is your first time using this auto installer script.

It may override your previous setting and update your apt repo's.

Recommended to using it at fresh new installed debian 6/7 32bit minimal

Acctually this script is for my own using at very lowend openvz vps.

I think its a good idea to share & have a feedback about it.

Proceed at your own risk. [y/n]:
